Important to have priorities. If you try to fix all problems at the same time you might end up fixing none of them.

We want the problems to happen as soon as possible in the program. The longer we let iffy stuff run the more problems it will cause and the more it will take to fix them. We also want the problems and failiures to be clear so we know what's wrong.

Use the language correctly

We want the code to be performant. But we don't want to over do it at the cost of other values.

Make sure game progress is not lost for the player in the case of a crash.
