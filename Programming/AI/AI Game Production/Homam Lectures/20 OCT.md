For the machine learning we need to give features, not an image.
We can extract different kinds of features.

HOG - Histogram Oriented Gradient

We send a vector of numbers to the machine learning.


###### Machine learning example

**Machine learning problems**
- **Classification**
Supervised learning -> We guide the machine with labels
Discrete labels
- **Clustering**
Unsupervised learning -> We dump features and ask the machine to group them
Unlabeled
- **Regression**
Supervised learning -> Predicting value based on previous values (Ex. prices)
Continous label

##### Kinds of machine learning
***
**Supervised learning**
Labeled

**Unsupervised learning**
Unlabeled

**Semi supervised learning**
We start with small classified data and use unsupervised learning to help expand the data.

**Reinforcement learning**
The machine learns based on feedback

**Meta learning**
All together

##### Algorithms
