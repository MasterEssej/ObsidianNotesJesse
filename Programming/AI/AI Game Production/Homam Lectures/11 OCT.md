# Lecture
We use c++ over other languages for the final implementation because in c++ we have more control over memory and better access to the hardware. 
Python is used more for application/interface but the final implementation is converted to c++.

#### Library
**Library:** A collection of pre-developed functions.

We will only use opencv to: Get Image, Load Image, Show Image.

We only need to know the .h and .lib from library to link it.

To run we need the DLL.


### Features of Mat
