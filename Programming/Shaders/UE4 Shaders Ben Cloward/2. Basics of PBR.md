### What is PBR?
- Physically Based Rendering
- Previous rendering tried to imitate the appearance of lighting
- Now we're imitating the actual behavior of light
- Makes graphics look more real

### PBR Components

#### Surface

##### Base Color
- Defines the diffuse color of the surface
- Real world materials are not darker than 20 or brighter than 240 sRGB
- Rough surfaces have a higher minimum ~50 sRGB
- Out of range values will not light correctly so staying in range is critical
- Do not include any lighting or shadows
- Base color textures should look very flat
- Use real-world measurments or captured data for best results

##### Normal
- Defines the shape of the surface
- Each pixel represents a vector that indicates the direction that the surface is facing
- Even when the mesh is perfectly flat, a normal map can make it appear bumpy
- Used to add a level of surface shape detail that's impossible to achieve with triangles
- Because they represent the vector data, normal maps should never be hand-authored

##### Specular
- A multiplier for the direct and indirect specular lighting
- Defines the reflectivity when looking straight at the surface
- Non-metal surfaces reflect about 4% of light
- 0.5 represents 4% reflection. 1.0 represents 8% reflection - too high for most objects
- At glancing angles, all surfaced are 100% reflective. Fresnel term build into the engine
- Specular maps should be mostly 0.5
- Only use darker shades to mask areas that should not be reflective - like crevices
- A crevice map multiplied by 0.5 makes a good specular map

##### Roughness
- Represents the roughness of the surface at a microscopic scale
- White(1) is rough and black(0) is smooth
- Controls the "focus" of the reflections
- Smooth = tight, sharp reflections
- Rough = Blurry, diffused reflections
- Roughness map has no technical constraints - completely artistic choice
- Artists can use this map to define the "character" of the surface and show its history
- Consider where a surface has been polished smooth, scuffed or aged

##### Metallic
- Two shaders in one - metallic blends between *Read below*
- Base color becomes specular instead of diffuse. Metal diffuse is black
- Specular range for base color is up to 100%. Most metals are between 60 and 100% reflective
- Be sure to use real-world measurements for metal color values - and keep them bright
- Specular input is ignored when Metallic is 1

- Switched the shader to metallic mode
- Grayscale values are weird. Best to use solid white or black
- When metallic is white, be sure to use correct base color values for metal
- There's no such thing as dark metal. All metals are 180 sRGB or brighter

*Read here*
The root node in the Unreal Material Editor has two shaders, one for metallic objects and one for non-metallic objects. The value in the "Metallic" socket decides which shader is used.
