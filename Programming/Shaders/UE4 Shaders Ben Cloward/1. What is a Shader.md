### What is a shader?
- Code that controls the color of each pixel 
- Usually runs on the graphics processor
- Create art with math

### Shaders today
- Game engines use advanced PBR (Physically based rendering) and lighting
- Lighting model is more locked down (under the hood, done by the engine)
- Shaders now feed the G buffer - color, normal, roughness, metallic
- Most engines have a built-in shader editor
- Shaders control material properties
